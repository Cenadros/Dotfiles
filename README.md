# Dotfiles

This repo is my personal configuration for my dotfiles. You can fork and customize everything.

## Installation

First, make sure you have `git` and `curl` installed. Then execute the [`installer`](installer) from your terminal.

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cenadros/Dotfiles/main/installer)

## Updating

Once installed you'll have available the alias `dot_update` which will update dotfiles as well 
as its dependencies.
